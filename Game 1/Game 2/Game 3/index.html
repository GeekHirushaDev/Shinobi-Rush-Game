            <p>
                <b>☞ Use space key to ninja jump.</b>
                <br>
                <b>☞ Use Enter key to start the game.</b>

            <br>

            <p>)⁠☞ Pay attention to the speed of your character: As you run, your character may speed up. Make
                sure to adjust your movements accordingly, especially when it comes to jumping over obstacles.

                <br><br>

                )⁠☞ Learn the basic jump mechanic: In most run and jump games, the height of your character's
                jump is determined by how long you hold down the jump button. Experiment with different jump timings to
                see what works best for each obstacle.

                <br><br>

                )⁠☞ Look ahead to plan your movements: Scan the level ahead for any upcoming obstacles or
                hazards. This way, you can anticipate when and where to jump.

                <br><br>

                )⁠☞ Practice your timing: As you progress through the levels, the timing required for jumping
                will become more challenging. Continuously practice your jumps to improve your timing and accuracy,
                which will help you overcome even the most difficult obstacles.

                <br><br>

                )⁠☞ Be patient and persistent: Remember that run and jump games can be difficult, no matter how
                simple the mechanics are. Don't get discouraged if you can't beat a level on your first try. Try
                practicing the jumps, fine-tuning your timing, and keeping a calm mindset. Eventually, you will get
                through it.
